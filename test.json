  html: "I had an affair. My husband checked out of our relationship a very long time ago...\nAs in... if I ever wanted him to have sex with me? Or just touch me? It felt to me, like it was the most disgusting chore he’d ever had to do in his life. Like, he almost recoiled at the thought of it. He actuality told me that, in his opinion, couples don’t need sex after a few years, and that the women who want it must be whores? In his opinion, women who like sex shouldn’t be with him. After THAT conversation?\n\nI felt so rejected, unwanted and icky.... \nSo.... wanting a man to want me.... I remembered a gal I’d worked with, telling me she liked to look up personal ads on Craigslist when she was bored and lonely....\n\nFeeling crazy lonely one nite, I did just that. I looked up Craigslist Personals. I answered an ad. He was married too. And just as lonely as me. I sent him an email....\nWe exchanged phone numbers and texted for several days. And finally met up one Sunday nite. \n\nNo regrets. At all.  We fucked that nite. \nWe had decent sex at first, then great sex.  Many times after that first nite....\nMeeting him? I felt so alive. So much more desired and wanted. \nHe was a grown ass man. ( my husband had never been able to “grow up” like that) \nThe man I was fucking around with? He had his own career. His own desires and dreams? He told me so many things about himself. I told him many things about me as well. We clicked so well. It was damn good. We also talked about our spouses. Why we didn’t click etc.... since we were a secret, I felt free to talk. So did he. I felt like a teenager with a crush I couldn’t get enough of. He told me he felt the same way as well. \nWe saw each other for many months. I was happier and feeling better than I had in a very long time. He was what my sore heart needed. \nIn more ways than I could’ve said at that point in my life. Phew. It was good. \n\nWell, after several weeks... My husband guessed I was fucking around....  when he confronted me... I told him everything. He didn’t like it. I’ve seen him angry and hurt, that was a whole new level of both.... \n\nwhen his anger and pain subsided however...\nHe also admitted that we should split, he was just as unhappy as me.  we are not right for each other. So...\n\nHere we are. Dividing up our lives. And actually getting along better than ever and becoming the friends we should have been all along. \n\nMy affair has ended.....Because I realized I was  falling for the guy I met on Craigslist. I am grown up enough and self-aware enough to know it couldn’t go further because of how we met... and why we met... and he also said he felt he could never leave his wife....\nso it’s over. He was an absolute gentleman when I told him too.... \nwhich was refreshing to me. Most men don’t react rationally, he did. He stepped back. Which is another reason I was glad I didn’t let myself fall in love with him. I could have. Easily... \nI don’t expect to see him again. He’s not leaving his wife to come find me again. I know that. It’s ok. \nLife doesn’t always work out the way we wish it would. Its unfair at times. As it should be, how else do we learn from it?\n\nHowever.... because I met him, I remembered how it good it feels to be wanted and desired by a man. How good it feels to have someone care about my needs and wants and all the things that matter to me. \nI had an affair, and I was able to talk so much more openly about how unhappy I was with the man I was living with, and gave him the chance to tell me as well. So we can no-love on as friends and amicably. \n\nI know most people would judge me for seeking something outside marriage before leaving for good? But as of now? It’s been exactly what we (my husband and me)  needed to be realize we aren’t right for each other. And we should move on. \n\nJudge me all you want. An affair I had totally given me myself back. \n\nNo regrets. At all. ",
