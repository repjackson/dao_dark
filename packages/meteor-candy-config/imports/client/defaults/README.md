# Client Default's 

When Meteor Candy launches, you can configure which views should open first.

`tab` refers to which section should open first. The options are: 
 	- Overview
 	- Recents
 	- Search
 	- Functions
 	- Settings

`dataTab` refers to which section with-in Overview should be opened first. You just need to define it with a string which matches with what you put into the configuration of Overview. 

For example, putting in "Total Accounts" would display the Total Accounts tab.
