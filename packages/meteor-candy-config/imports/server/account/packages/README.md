# Package Support

Every Account package has a slight difference, and its important that we can support these differences. This is why Meteor Candy scans through your package list and tries to determine what things to look for. 

Meteor Candy supports all the vendor-provided Accounts packages. However, if you are using a modified version, or a third-party account package, you can probably plug it in by adding it to the package list.
