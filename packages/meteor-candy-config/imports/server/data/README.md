The data with-in this object will be used to power the Overview tab of your application. The goal is to give some "at-a-glance" statistics, such as how many users there are in the database or how many people joined in the last month.

`name` and `value` refer to what you will see on the sidebar. Mainly, its the name of the dataset and a badge. In the example,  one of the way its used is to display how many "Total Accounts" there are in the database.

`content` refers to what data will be displayed in the main area once that section is selected. See "Sample Data" for an example of how it works.
